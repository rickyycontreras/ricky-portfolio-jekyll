  <h2>Community</h2>
  <p>I create spaces that connect people — from sober dance events to flea markets and local panels. My events focus on accessibility, inclusion, and meaningful conversation.</p>

  <h3>Highlights</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Sober dance series — daytime events prioritizing community and mental health</li>
    <li>Local flea markets & community gatherings</li>
    <li>Meaningful conversation nights (inspired by “Meaningful Mondays”)</li>
  </ul>
